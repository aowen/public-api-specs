<h2 id="audience-and-purpose">Audience and Purpose</h2>


<p>
This guide is intended to drive <em>technical</em> conversations between Scoir and Application Platforms to achieve specificity around each of the necessary integration points outlined in subsequent sections.

<h2 id="high-level-integration-flow">High-Level Integration Flow</h2>


<ul>

<li>When a Scoir student starts a college application, Scoir will send the student’s <a href="#application-profile-specification">Application Profile</a> to the Application Platform in order to pre-fill answers to standard questions

<li>The Application Platform will notify Scoir when it has processed the<a href="#application-profile-specification"> Application Profile </a>so the student can take subsequent steps toward submitting the application

<li>A Scoir student will single sign-on (SSO) into the Application Platform to review and submit their college application, including answering institution-specific questions and payment of any fees

<li>The Application Platform will notify Scoir when the application has been submitted

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions </h2>


<h3 id="initiating-applications">Initiating Applications</h3>


<p>

    Q:	What are Scoir’s expectations of the Application Platform’s “initiate” API?
</p>
<p>

    A:	The API should accept and process a single Scoir Student’s <a href="#application-profile-specification">Application Profile</a> in near “real time”.  Scoir expects that a student can 
</p>
<p>

    initiate, complete and submit an application in a single interactive session.  
</p>
<p>

    Q:	Does Scoir have an API authentication preference?
</p>
<p>

    A:	No, the Application Platform determines authentication requirements.  Scoir will support any reasonable authentication mechanisms 
</p>
<p>

    used to secure the API (i.e. API key, PKI, etc.).  
</p>
<p>

    Q:	Does Scoir have an API design preference?  
</p>
<p>

    A:	Yes, Scoir prefers REST/JSON APIs.
</p>
<p>

    Q:	What happens when a  student updates their profile on Scoir after submitting an application?
</p>
<p>

    A:	Scoir intends to report such changes to the Application Platform in near “real time”. It is up to the Application Platform to determine 
</p>
<p>

    whether Scoir calls the “initiate” API endpoint again or a separate API endpoint intended solely for reporting changes to a student’s 
</p>
<p>

    Application Profile. 
</p>
<h3 id="reporting-application-status">Reporting Application Status</h3>


<p>

    Q:	When should the Application Platform call the status API?
</p>
<p>

    A:	Scoir wants to provide a near “real-time” experience for students and counselors, so the expectation is that the Application Platform 
</p>
<p>

    will report changes in application status as soon as they occur.  
</p>
<p>

    Q:	What information does the Application Platform need to send to Scoir each time a status change occurs?
</p>
<p>

    A:	Refer to the Application Status API specification [insert link] for these details
</p>
<p>
	
</p>
<h3 id="student-application-submission">Student Application Submission</h3>


<p>

    Q: 	Must the Application Platform support the ability for a student to SSO into the Application Platform?
</p>
<p>

    A:	Yes.  Scoir doesn’t currently provide a way for students to answer institution-specific questions or submit application payments and 
</p>
<p>

    expects that the student will be able to SSO into the application platform, from Scoir, to complete these tasks.  	
</p>
<p>

    Q: 	Does Scoir have a preferred method for asserting user details in support of SSO?
</p>
<p>

    A:	Yes, Scoir prefers using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> .
</p>
<p>

    Q:	Who determines the encryption scheme for the JWT SSO tokens?
</p>
<p>

    A:	The Application Platform determines encryption requirements. Scoir will support any reasonable encryption approach using 
</p>
<p>

    symmetric or asymmetric cryptography
</p>
<p>

    Q:	Can Scoir suggest resources to learn more about how JWT SSO works?
</p>
<p>

    A:	Yes, Zendesk has published a great article about <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408845838874-Enabling-JWT-JSON-Web-Token-single-sign-on">Enabling JWT single sign-on</a>.
